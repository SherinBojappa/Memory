# Memory

This project uses recurrent neural networks and CNNs to test the task of memory retention.

Instructions to run - first run dataset_creation.py to create the dataset adn then run memory_encoder_mlp.py to evaluate memory retention.
1. dataset_creation.py - script to create synthetic dataset and save it on disk
2. memory_encoder_mlp.py - LSTM, RNN, and CNN models to test memory retention task.
